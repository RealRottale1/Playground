                    Despite what the name implies, Coolmath Games is not a lame website but actually the most fun website to ever exist. It's jam packed with loads of fun and unique games. When I was in elementary school, before school would start I would always go to the computer lab and hop on Coolmath Games.

                <p class="section_body_cm">
                    For me, the only real competitor for Coolmath was HoodaMath. HoodaMath was like Coolmath but with worse games and fewer games to play. HoodMath basically died in between my 5th-grade year, which forced me to only play Coolmath games.

                    I stopped playing Coolmath Games a long time ago, and checking in on Coolmath today, I can unfortunately say that Coolmath Games was better when I was in 5th grade. The two main reasons Coolmath is worse now than it was before is because all the good flash games are unplayable and because they have loads of ads, which cause the games to lag.
